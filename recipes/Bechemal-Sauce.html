    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Béchamel is a versatile white sauce and the base of a variety of comfort food dishes. As one of five mother sauces in French cuisine, it’s versatile and easy to master, with only a few ingredients—butter, milk, flour, eggs, and salt.</p>

    <p>These days, the sauce is most often finished with a bit of salt and black pepper, plus a few good grates of fresh nutmeg—that’s it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepot over medium heat, warm the butter until melted. Gradually add flour and stir with a wooden spoon until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook the mixture for 2–3 minutes, keeping a close eye on it to avoid unwanted burning. In a separate saucepot, heat the milk until it is just about to boil.</li>
        <li>Add the hot milk to the butter mixture, ½ cup at a time, constantly whisking. Cook 12 minutes, stirring constantly. Turn heat off.</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in 1 egg yolk at a time. Season with salt and nutmeg.</li>
    </ol>
