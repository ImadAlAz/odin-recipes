    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Croque monsieur literally means “mister crunch,” and it’s also a classic French bar snack, a sandwich consisting of gruyère cheese, ham, and buttered bread. The bread is either toasted until the cheese melts or fried in butter, like a grilled cheese.</p>

    <p>It first appeared on French menus in the early twentieth century and has since spread throughout the world. In France, it’s typically made with pain de mie, a soft, white, rectangular sandwich loaf, but croques can also be made with white country-style bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tbsp plus 8 tbsp unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>8 ½-inch-thick slices pain de mie or other white bread</li>
        <li>8 slices ham, such as French jambon</li>
        <li>8 slices Gruyère cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="Bechemal-Sauce.html"><em>Make the béchamel sauce:</em></a> In a medium saucepot over medium heat, warm 5 tablespoons butter until melted. Gradually add flour and stir with a wooden spoon until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook the mixture for 2-3 minutes, keeping a close eye on it to avoid unwanted burning. In a separate saucepot, heat the milk until it is just about to boil.</li>
        <li>Add the hot milk to the butter mixture, ½ cup at a time, constantly whisking. Cook 12 minutes, stirring constantly. Turn heat off.</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in 1 egg yolk at a time. Season with salt and nutmeg. Heat oven to 300°F.</li>
        <li>Assemble the sandwich: Generously spread four slices of bread with béchamel sauce. Top each with ham and cheese and cover with remaining bread.</li>
        <li>Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons butter and brush both sides of sandwiches with melted butter. Fry sandwiches in a hot cast iron pan or on a griddle until golden brown. Top sandwiches with more béchamel sauce and transfer to the oven to continue cooking until cheese bubbles, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
